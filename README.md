# My Kattis Solutions

Both for fun and as a competitive programming coach I've solved several problems on https://open.kattis.com/. This repository contains some of my solutions. As I have decided to back these up, I figured why not make them public in case anyone out there was curious.

## My Author Profile

Besides my capacity as a coach/judge/etc., I've also been a problem author on several occasions. If you are curious, you can find my problem/stats [here](https://open.kattis.com/problem-authors/Joshua%20T.%20Guerin)!
