# Union-Find
## C++: unionfind.cpp
*Accepted by open.kattis.com.*
Notes:
* Straight-forward Union-Find impleentation from CP3 (Haim, Haim)

Update 05/17/2018
* Original version no longer accepted due to timeout (>1.00 seconds).
* Submission works with scanf, not with >>.
* It looks like cin >> is too slow for some problems?

## Python3: unionfind.py
*Times out in test 3 on open.kattis.com.*
* Python3 may not work for this problem due to efficiency.
* Same implementation as above.
